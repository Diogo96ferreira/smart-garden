This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Weather‑Aware Watering (New)

- The dashboard now sends your location (if set during onboarding) to `/api/generate-tasks`.
- The server uses Open‑Meteo (no API key required) to fetch recent rain and sunshine, then:
  - Skips creating watering tasks for today if it rained ≥ 5 mm yesterday.
  - Adjusts effective watering frequency dynamically:
    - More rain → water less often (increase interval).
    - More sun/heat → water more often (decrease interval).

Notes:

- Location is read from `localStorage` key `userLocation` (and falls back to `garden.settings.v1` → `userLocation`).
- If location is unavailable, watering behavior remains unchanged.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
